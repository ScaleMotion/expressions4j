== About ==

Jexpr (Java Expression Evaluator) is a project intended to embed expressions to Java programs. The typical use-cases is
when you need to generate expression from user input or expose some rules to configuration files of your applications.

==Getting jexpr==


* Direct jars downloads: [http://vklimontovich.github.com/maven2/jexpr/jexpr/1.0 JExpr-1.0]
* Plugin a maven repository to pom.xml

```xml
        <repository>
            <id>vklimontovich-github</id>
            <url>http://vklimontovich.github.com/maven2/</url>
        </repository>
```

and use it as dependency

<code>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jexpr</groupId>
            <artifactId>jexpr</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
</code>




==Usage==

=== Advantages === 

* API is language-agnostic. Using some API you could treat expressions as Java or JavaScript (Groovy/Scala support is on its way;
ff cause, expressions syntax would be different for different language).
* Excellent API/Interoperability: it allows to expose functions/constants/variables to your expressions very easily
* It's lightweigh. It has zero dependecies. You should plug [http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/ javassist]/[http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ Rhino] library to classpath depending on what language 
you're using. 

=== Basic examples === 

<code>
   System.out.println(new JavaExpressionCompiler().compile("return 2 + 2;", Object.class, int.class).evaluate(null));

   //will output 4
</code>

<code>
   System.out.println(new JSExpressionCompiler().compile("5 * 5;", Object.class, int.class).evaluate(null));

   //will output 25
</code>

=== What's underneath === 

You may ask why this library is better than [http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/ javassist] or [http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ Rhino]. The truth is it's not. Jexpr is just a thin wrapper around those libraries that allows to plug dynamic expression evaluation with lesser code.

== API ==

The well documented examples is the best doc: https://github.com/vklimontovich/jexpr/blob/master/src/main/java/jexpr/examples/Examples.java

== Maven integration ==

Maven repository is coming soon!
