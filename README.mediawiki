== About ==

Jexpr (Java Expression Evaluator) is a project intended to embed expressions to Java programs. The typical use-cases is
when you need to generate expression from user input or expose some rules to configuration files of your applications.

==Getting jexpr==


* Direct jars downloads: [http://vklimontovich.github.com/maven2/jexpr/jexpr/1.0 JExpr-1.0]
* Plugin a maven repository to pom.xml
        <repository>
            <id>vklimontovich-github</id>
            <url>http://vklimontovich.github.com/maven2/</url>
        </repository>
and use it as dependency
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jexpr</groupId>
            <artifactId>jexpr</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
==Usage==

=== Advantages === 

* API is language-agnostic. Using some API you could treat expressions as Java or JavaScript (Groovy/Scala support is on its way;
ff cause, expressions syntax would be different for different language).
* Excellent API/Interoperability: it allows to expose functions/constants/variables to your expressions very easily
* It's lightweigh. It has zero dependecies. You should plug [http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/ javassist]/[http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ Rhino] library to classpath depending on what language 
you're using. 

=== Basic examples === 
   
   System.out.println(new JavaExpressionCompiler().compile("return 2 + 2;", Object.class, int.class).evaluate(null));
   //will output 4

   System.out.println(new JSExpressionCompiler().compile("5 * 5;", Object.class, int.class).evaluate(null));
   //will output 25

=== Dependencies === 

Jexpr has 0 runtime dependencies itself. However you might plugin javassist/rhino/both library depending of what kind of expressions are you going to use. Jexpr was tested with javassisit 3.12.1.GA and rhino 1.7R2. It also should work with higher major versions. If you're using maven you might plugin one of (or both):

        <dependency>
            <groupId>rhino</groupId>
            <artifactId>js</artifactId>
            <version>1.7R2</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javassist</groupId>
            <artifactId>javassist</artifactId>
            <version>3.12.1.GA</version>
        </dependency>
